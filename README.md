# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
I was tasked to put together data for the best vacation spots in the world. This included my creation of databases listing each locations, the local weather, and hotel information using Google APIs. I hit a few snags along the way with my code and kept testing and debugging until the end. For deliverable 3, I had trouble creating the itineray map due to an error that I could not figure how to get past.
